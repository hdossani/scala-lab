# Scala Lab

## What is Scala?
   * 'Scala' means Scalable Language. 
   * It's a Functional and Object Oriented Programming Language.
   * It's a Strongly Typed Language.
   * Started in 2001 at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) by Martin Odersky.
   * Released publicly in 2004.

## Why learn Scala?

  * Better developer productivity.
  * More expressive Language.
  * Type Inference.
  * Functional Language by design.
  * Better support for immutability.
  * Better support for Parallel Programming.
  * Largely adopted on the 'Big Data' space. 
  * JVM Based language. 
  * Interoperability with Java, including frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.
  * Usage of existing Java libraries.
  * Good tooling and documentation.
  * Several cool features, such as Pattern Matching, For-Comprehensions, Traits, named and Default Parameters, etc.
  * Makes you a better programmer in other languages such as Java and Javascript.

## Lab Exercises

The exercises for this lab are organized in an implementation/unit test format. A partial implementation of the functions is supplied and you then have to replace the **_???_** (not yet implemented operator) with Scala code so the unit tests will pass.

### Setup

1. Install IntelliJ IDEA 2016.3
2. Install Scala Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
3. Go to File | Project Structure | Global Libraries | Add Scala SDK
4. Add Scala SDK
5. Choose version 2.11.8
6. Clone or download this github repository
7. Run `mvn clean compile scala:compile scala:testCompile test`
8. Create an Empty IntelliJ project
9. Go to File | New | Module from existing Sources
10. Choose Maven Module

At this point, you should be able to run and debug the code/unit tests within IntelliJ IDEA.

### Running the tests with Maven

`mvn clean compile scala:compile scala:testCompile test`

### Solutions

The solutions for all the exercises are available on GitHub repository history. Git Hash `d1fbabd28d81b3b7562c6ee08fb5f3f3aa4babc1`.
